# Simple Interest Calculator

This project explains how to calculate **Simple Interest** using a basic formula.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per year)
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Description
This repository contains documentation for a simple interest calculator and can be extended into a program using any programming language.
